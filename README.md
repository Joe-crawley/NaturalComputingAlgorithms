This project involved deploying natural computing algorithms to solve common optimisation problems, The discrete optimisation problem chosen is graph colouring, the real optimisation is parameter selection for function minimisation, negative selection was solved using V-Detectors https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9066100](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025508005434.
Improvements are made onto these algorithms and are discussed within the report.

The natural algorithm chosen for Discrete and real optimisation was whale optimisation https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.03389.
